# Arena
A amicable community with some specific set of goals and rules , to help each other grow in the field we are already thriving.

Project Goals:
To create a website which will act as Forum/Platform/Ask Help Chat. 
The Forum will help beginners to ask questions about the latest technology they are working on and can learn from the closed community.
The Platform will help someone find like-minded people with whom they can pursue a Project and get insights and Feedbacks from the rest of the community.
There will be a chat facility too to get instant help on some subject.



#AIM
